### Keys
-> Way to specify how tuples within a given relation are distinguished.
-> `Expressed in terms of their attributes`.

1. `super key`:A super key is a set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, can uniquely identify tuples (rows) within a table. It can include more attributes than necessary to uniquely identify rows, making it a broader concept.
ex: 

3. `candidate key`:specific type of super key that uniquely identifies each tuple in a table and is composed of multiple attributes together. Unlike a super key, a composite key is minimal, meaning it's the smallest set of attributes needed to uniquely identify rows.

```
NOTE It is possible that several distinct sets of attributes could serve as a candidate key. Suppose that a combination of name and dept name is sufficient to distinguish among members of the instructor relation. Then, both {ID} and {name, dept name} are candidate keys. Although the attributes ID and name together can distinguish instructor tuples, their combination, {ID, name}, does not form a candidate key, since the attribute ID alone is a candidate key
```

4. `primary key`: A candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as principle means of identifying tuples within a  relation. {it is underlined}
5. `foreign key`: establish relation between two tables. It is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. {Maintain data integrity:BLACK-BOX}
